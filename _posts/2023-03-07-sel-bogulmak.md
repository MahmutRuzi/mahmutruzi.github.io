The person of private virtuousness “shut his mouth and his eyes to the injustice around him,” limiting his public activities and focusing his energies on his circle of family and friends—raising his children and tending his own garden—and professing a lack of interest in what he will no doubt call “politics.” -Dietrich Bonhoeffer, from [The Great Masquerade of Evil](https://ravenmagazine.org/magazine/the-great-masquerade-of-evil/) by Kyla Ebels- Duggan, the Raven Magazine, Fall 2021, accessed on March 7th 2023.

Amir was sitting on a stool, arms folded together across the chest, shivering. It was’t a good day for him as he had only made 6 TL so far. Even though it was July, Istanbul was misty and cold, and the rain had weakened to drizzle, but the wind had picked up, slapping the rain against his face. Amir stood up and folded the torn dark brown towel pieces, then put them along with the brushes and tubes of shoe polishes in the rusty wooden box. He closed and locked the box, folded the canvas stool, picked it up with his left hand, and carried the wooden box on his right hand. He walked towards Inceyol road to avoid the rain and wind. Here, all the shops and the restaurant had porches extending well into the sidewalk. He walked slowly and carefully, trying not to slip or to step on the broken beer bottles. A dog followed him, as it had been ever since the one cold winter night when Amir gave it a piece of bread. Although the dog sometimes walked off with other stray dogs, it always came back to him, usually after a few hours. 

Amir turned left onto Inceyol road and hurried past the restaurant, resisting the aroma of barbecued lamb. He glanced into the convenience store, slowed down, and stopped when he saw the familiar face of the old grocer. Amir knew that the grocer was kind to him, unlike the grocer’s son who would usually chase him away, or the restaurant owner who would curse and through away his belongs. Amir put down the wooden box, opened the canvas stool after shaking off the rain, and sat down. The dog followed suit, shaking and splashing raindrops on Amir, who tried to shoo it away. Eventually, the dog sat next to him on the pavement. Although Amir knew that this side road wouldn’t have many customers, the comfort away from the wind and rain was what he was bargaining for. 

Amir was shivering in the cold and had curled up. He removed his wet sandals and tucked his feet under the dog lying next for warmth. The old grocer, who was watching TV behind his counter,  noticed the boy and walked up to the foggy window, and had a look at Amir. A few minutes later, he came out with a cup in his hand. 
'Here, have a cup of hot tea!' the old man said, handing the cup to Amir. 
Amir, feeling embarrassed, quickly withdraw his feet from under the dog, put on his sandals, and stood up to take the cup. He said ‘Thanks!’ The old man returned to his store. 
'Thanks' was one of the few Turkish words that Amir had learned from his brother Ahmed over the last few months. He had also learned words like “Please,”  “Yes,”  “Enjoy,” “Ataturk,” and the numbers one to ten. However, he gave up on learning more words since most of his friends and neighbors didn’t  speak Turkish either. 

Amir held the tea cup tightly with both hands to keep them warm and took slow sips. The dog noticed and came over to him, sitting down next to him after a few pats and strokes. The warmth from the tea and the dog’s presence made aware of his hunger. He realized that the bread with black olives he had for breakfast did’t sustained him for long. The tea didn’t last long either. 

Amir walked into the store and returned the empty cup to the old man, who was watching a small TV mounted on a wall in the corner of the store. Amir thanked him for the tea and went to the bakery section to grabbed a loaf of bread . When he returned to pay, the old man pointed to the TV where men with rifles and black flags were running through abandoned streets with destroyed houses and rubbles. 

The scenes on the TV triggered Amir's memories of his home back in Afghanistan, and he looked scared and his eyes diluted and eyebrows looked wet.  He showed the grocer the bread in one hand and held out three one TL bills in the other, both slightly shaking. The grocer kept saying “Syria’” while pointing at the TV. But after getting no response from Amir, the grocer then said “enjoy” and gestured Amir to the door. 

Amir tried to compose himself and finally managed to say “please" while extending both hands, one holding the bread and the other showing the bills. He struggled to hold back his tears and to keep his hands still. Suddenly, the dog started barking and walking towards the store. Amir quickly dropped the bills on the desk, thanked the grocer while looking down to hide his tears. He then took the bread and ushered the dog out of the store. 

Amir hoped that the grocer had not noticed the tears that burst out. As he walked to the stool, the dog followed him, barking. He sat  down quietly on the canvas stool. After realizing the barking dog, he split one piece of bread and placed it on the pavement next to the wall. The dog rushed to it, barking and wagging its tail. Amir and took a big bite of his piece of the bread. His mouth was full, but the bread was dry and hard, making it difficult to chew.

As if noticed this, the grocer emerged from the store with another cup of tea. He handed it to Amir and also put two liras to Amir's pocket. Then, he patted Amir on the shoulder, smiled, and walked back inside. Amir shouted “Thanks” after the old man. He finished the bread quickly but held onto the warm tea cup, clutching it with both hands close to his chest.
