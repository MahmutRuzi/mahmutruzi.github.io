excerpt: 'we prepare a fluorine-free superhydrophobic coating from hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles that can be easily applied to common fabrics by simply spray coating, leading to superhydrophobic fabrics with a water contact angle of 172째 and a sliding angle of 3째.

Abstract: Water repellency is a desired feature of fabrics for certain applications in textile industry such as water-repellent garments, tents, and umbrellas. Coating of fabrics with fluorocarbons or silicones followed by heat treatment is the general process to impart hydrophobicity even though the resulted water repellency is limited. In this study, we prepare a fluorine-free superhydrophobic coating from hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles that can be easily applied to common fabrics by simply spray coating, leading to superhydrophobic fabrics with a water contact angle of 172째 and a sliding angle of 3째. The process to achieve extreme water repellency is simple and only involves a single step, and there is no need for further processes like annealing or heat treatment. The superhydrophobic coated fabrics display durability dependence on the texture of the underlying material, where coated chenille and nonwoven fabrics show robust mechanical durability against water impact, abrasion, and laundering. The ready availability of the coating materials, the simple process of application, and the robust mechanical durability of superhydrophobic fabrics show great potential for real-world applications.
