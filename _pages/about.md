Welcome to my personal website! My name is Mahmut Ruzi and I am a research fellow at Erciyes University's [Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (ERNAM)](https://ernam.erciyes.edu.tr), working in the lab of [Prof. M. Serdar Onses](http://www.onseslab.com). I have a Ph.D. in chemistry and spent over 10 years researching and studying vibrational spectroscopy, specifically Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. I have also recently started focusing on the practical applications of my research, including the creation of plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced infrared absorption and Raman scattering.

In addition to this, I am also interested in the fabrication and characterization of super water repellent coatings and surfaces, also known as superhydrophobic surfaces. These surfaces have extremely low surface energy and are extremely repellent to water and other high surface energy liquids. They are created by combining a microscopically rough surface with low surface energy, making them extremely effective at repelling water and other liquids.These surfaces have many interesting potential applications and I am excited to continue researching and exploring them.
