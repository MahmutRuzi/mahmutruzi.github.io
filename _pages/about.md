Welcome to my personal website! My name is Mahmut Ruzi and I am a research fellow at Erciyes University's [Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (ERNAM)](https://ernam.erciyes.edu.tr), working in the lab of [Prof. M. Serdar Onses](http://www.onseslab.com). I have a Ph.D. in chemistry and specialize in vibrational spectroscopy, specifically Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. With over 10 years of experience in this field, I have also recently started focusing on the practical aspects of creating plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced infrared absorption and Raman scattering.

In addition to this, I am also interested in the fabrication and characterization of super water repellent coatings and surfaces, also known as superhydrophobic surfaces. These surfaces have extremely low surface energy and are extremely repellent to water and other high surface energy liquids.
