Abstract: “There is a strong need for mechanically robust superhydrophobic coatings that can be manufactured from eco-friendly and sustainable materials for a broad portfolio of applications. Here, we report the preparation of a composite suspension coating from biocompatible carnauba wax and polydimethylsiloxane, and demonstrate its superhydrophobicity and resistance to water impact. The superhydrophobicity and mechanical stability of the coated surfaces can be controlled by adjusting the concentrations of constituent materials. The composite suspension can be easily drop cast or spray-coated on common materials, such as glass and paper, wherein the coated surface exhibits excellent superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning property. Glass substrates spray-coated with the composite suspension demonstrate high levels of resistance against water impact, retaining superhydrophobicity even after the impact of 250,000 water droplets.”
