Welcome! I’m Mahmut Ruzi, Ph.D., a research fellow at the Erciyes University, Kayseri, the [Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (ERNAM)](https://ernam.erciyes.edu.tr), working in the lab of [Prof. M. Serdar Onses](http://www.onseslab.com). I’m a chemist by trainin, with a focus on vibrational spectroscopy, with more than ten years of experience in fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,spectral acquisition, intepretation,and quatum mechanical calculations of rovibrational properties of molecules. Recently shifted focused onto more practical aspects such as fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) and Raman scattering (SERS). 

Another interesting research area is fabrication and characterization of super water repellent coatings and surfaces, and their application. Thess surfaces are also termed superhydrophobic, due to their extreme repellency against water and other high surface energy (>50 mJ/m^2^) liquids. A small (< 2 mm) water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface beads up, takes a spherical shape (almost) and rolls off very easily. Such surfaces and coatings have a number of interesting applications such as self-cleaning windows, [blood repellent devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111864), and condensing effect so that a small amount of molecules can be further conccentrated on a small area. [Combining the latter effect with chemical sensing techniques such as SERS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133445), one can detect very minute amounts ta of tag molecules. This has some nice application potential in areas like biosensing, food quality control,  and environemtnal monitoring of pullutants and [toxic chemicals](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.2c02897).
