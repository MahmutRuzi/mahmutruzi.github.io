I use my skills to answer some important questions in chemistry and material science, and can learn new ones as required. One such question is how to develop a convenient and low cost technique to fabricate high performance plasmonic nanostructures for SEIRA and SERS. With such structures, it’s possible to quickly detect and identify minute amounts of target molecules in areas such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diagnosis,and identification of pathogenic bacteria and virues. Besides getting hands ‘dirty’ in the lab to fabricate such structures, I also simulate light scattering and absorption properties of the structures to shed light on the measured spectra. For such simulations, I regularly use finite difference time domain (FDTD), the transfer matrix method (TMM), the rigorously coupled wave analysis (RCWA) approach, and the boundary element method (BEM) with corresponding codes like Meep (FDTD, Python), pyGTM (TMM, Python), RETICOLO (RCWA, Matlab), MNPBEM and NANOBEM (BEM, Matlab). For some complex simulations, I use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructures.

Another research area I recently find my footing on is superhydrophobic surfaces. These surfaces are very slippery and very repellent to water. Such surfaces naturally do exist, such as the leaves of lotus and duck feather. A small (< 2 mm) water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface beads up, takes a spherical shape (almost) and rolls off very easily. Therefore, tends to stay very clean. Superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings have a number of interesting applications such as self-cleaning windows, [blood repellent devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111864), and condensing effect so that a small amount of molecules can be further concentrated on a small area. [Combining the latter effect with chemical sensing techniques such as SERS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133445), one can detect very minute amounts of tag molecules. This has some nice application potential in areas like bio-sensing, food quality control,  and environmental monitoring of pollutants and [toxic chemicals](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.2c02897).
