**Plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced vibrational spectroscopy**

With plasmonic nanostructures, it’s possible to enhance the vibrational signal of molecules to a few million times. Hence,it becomes possible to quickly detect and identify minute amounts of target molecules in areas such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diagnosis,and identification of pathogenic bacteria and virues. Besides getting hands ‘dirty’ in the lab to fabricate such structures, I also simulate light scattering and absorption properties of the structures to shed light on the measured spectra. For such simulations, I regularly use finite difference time domain (FDTD), the transfer matrix method (TMM), the rigorously coupled wave analysis (RCWA) approach. For some complex simulations, I use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructures.

**Superwetting surfaces and coatings**

Another research area I recently find my footing on is superhydrophobic surfaces. These surfaces are very slippery and very repellent to water. Such surfaces naturally do exist, such as the leaves of lotus and duck feather. A small (< 2 mm) water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface beads up, takes a spherical shape (almost) and rolls off very easily. Therefore, tends to stay very clean. Superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings have a number of interesting applications such as self-cleaning windows, [blood repellent devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111864), and condensing effect so that a small amount of molecules can be further concentrated on a small area. [Combining the latter effect with chemical sensing techniques such as SERS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133445), one can detect very minute amounts of tag molecules. This has some nice application potential in areas like bio-sensing, food quality control,  and environmental monitoring of pollutants and [toxic chemicals](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.2c02897). 

**Codes**

Some of my previous and current work heavily involves simulation, for which I generally use open-source packages or write my own codes. I am experienced in Matlab and taking up python. Some matlab codes are available in matlabcentral website. Another one is deposited at the [University of Bern](https://boris.unibe.ch/146948/), Switzerland. It's a series of matlab functions for the extraction of refractive indices from aerosol extinction spectra, using Mie theory. 

Other codes are available in github, especially [here](https://github.com/MahmutRuzi/photonics-sim-examples).
