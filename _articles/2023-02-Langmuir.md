excerpt: "This study report a fluorine-free and biocompatible superhydrophobic coating that can be thermally healed after abrasion. The coating is composed of silica nanoparticles and carnauba wax, and the self-healing is based on surface enrichment of wax in analogy to the wax secretion in plant leaves. The coating not only exhibits fast self-healing, just in 1 min under moderate heating, but also displays increased water repellency and thermal stability after healing."

Abstract: The broad application potential of superhydrophobic coatings is limited by the usage of environment-threatening materials and poor durability. The nature-inspired design and fabrication of self-healing coatings is a promising approach for addressing these issues. In this study, we report a fluorine-free and biocompatible superhydrophobic coating that can be thermally healed after abrasion. The coating is composed of silica nanoparticles and carnauba wax, and the self-healing is based on surface enrichment of wax in analogy to the wax secretion in plant leaves. The coating not only exhibits fast self-healing, just in 1 min under moderate heating, but also displays increased water repellency and thermal stability after healing. The rapid self-healing ability of the coating is attributed to the relatively low melting point of carnauba wax and its migration to the surface of the hydrophilic silica nanoparticles. The dependence of self-healing on the size and loading of particles provides insights into the process. Furthermore, the coating exhibits high levels of biocompatibility where the viability of fibroblast L929 cells was âˆ¼90%. The presented approach and insights provide valuable guidelines in the design and fabrication of self-healing superhydrophobic coatings.
