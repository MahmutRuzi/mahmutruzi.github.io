A set of functions has been developed in MATLAB to retrieve refractive indices from aerosol particle extinction spectra with the classical damped harmonic oscillator model. The aerosols are assumed to be spherical so that Mie theory can be applied to calculate the extinction efficiency and its derivatives. The particle size distribution is lognormal but can be easily adapted to other forms of distributions. The retrieved parameters are the particle distributions mean radius rm, the standard deviation œÉ, the dielectric constants at high frequency ùúÄ‚àûÃá , and the classical damped harmonic oscillator band parameters, from which the refractive indices can be calculated. As a test, we extract the refractive indices of water ice and the particle size distributions from an extinction spectrum in the mid infrared region. The code was written while I was doing my PhD at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia, in collaboration with Prof.Christian M√§tzler of University of Bern,Switzerland and my PhD advisor Dr. Evan Robertson.
