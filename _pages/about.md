Welcome! I’m Mahmut Ruzi, Ph.D., a research fellow at the Erciyes University, Kayseri, the [Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (ERNAM)](https://ernam.erciyes.edu.tr), working in the lab of [Prof. M. Serdar Onses](http://www.onseslab.com). I’m a chemist by trainin, with a focus on vibrational spectroscopy, with more than ten years of experience in fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,spectral acquisition, intepretation,and quatum mechanical calculations of rovibrational properties of molecules. Recently shifted focused onto more practical aspects such as fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) and Raman scattering (SERS). Another interesting research area is fabrication and characterization of super water repellent coatings and surfaces, and their application.
