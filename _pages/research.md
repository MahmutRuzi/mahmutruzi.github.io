I use my skills to answere some important questions in chemistry and material science, and can learn new ones as required. One such question is how to develop a covenient and low cost technique to fabricate high performance plasmonic nanostructurs for SEIRA and SERS. With such structures, it’s possible to quickly detect and identify minute amounts of target molecules in areas such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diganosis,and identification of pathogenic bacteria and virues. Besides getting hands ‘dirty’ in the lab to fabricate such structures, I also simulate light scattering and absorption properties of the structures to shed light on the measured spectra. For such simulations, I regularly use finite difference time domain (FDTD), the transfer matrix method (TMM), the rigorously coupled wave analysis (RCWA) approach, and the boundry element method (BEM) with corresponding codes like Meep (FDTD, Python), pyGTM (TMM, Python), RETICOLO (RCWA, Matlab), MNPBEM and NANOBEM (BEM, Matlab). For some complex simulations, I use high performance computiong (HPC) infrastructres.

Another recent research interest is a facile fabrication of super water repellent coatings, which is also called superhydrophobic.
