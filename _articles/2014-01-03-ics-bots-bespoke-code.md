Abstract: Acetonitrile (CH3CN) and water (H2O) ice particles were generated within a collisional cooling cell coupled to the Australian Synchrotron light source. The evolution of the aerosols was tracked by infrared spectroscopy compiled over the 4000–50 cm–1 region. Gas pressure and temperature conditions were varied to replicate the lower altitudes of the Titan atmosphere allowing for comparison to far-infrared features detected by the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft. The experimental spectra show that CH3CN and H2O particles are microheterogeneous in composition and spherical in shape. CH3CN lattice bands display temperature-dependent shifts in frequency, implying that pure β-phase is present in the mixed particles. In addition, a red shift identified for the C≡N fundamental stretching mode indicates dipole–dipole and π-electron side-directed hydrogen bond coupling between segregated CH3CN and H2O phases exclusively at the grain interface. Discrete dipole approximation theory was implemented to evaluate various cluster architectures where segregated domains of pure CH3CN and H2O ices provided the best fit to experiment; confirming the infrared findings. Otherwise, simulations of competing architectures, such as core–shell and cubic shaped particles, did not provide convincing comparison to the aerosol spectra. We conclude that the far-infrared profiles for mixed CH3CN–H2O systems do not present as likely carriers for the unassigned 220 cm–1 “haystack” feature that has been identified in Titan’s lower atmosphere.
