My research focuses on two main areas: plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced vibrational spectroscopy and superwetting surfaces and coatings. 

**Plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced vibrational spectroscopy**

In this area, I work on fabricating plasmonic nanostructures that can enhance the vibrational signal of molecules by a few million times, making it possible to quickly detect and identify small amounts of target molecules in various fields such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and food quality control. I also use simulations to study the light scattering and absorption properties of these structures, using techniques such as finite difference time domain (FDTD), the transfer matrix method (TMM), and the rigorously coupled wave analysis (RCWA) approach.

**Superwetting surfaces and coatings**

In the second area of my research, I study superhydrophobic surfaces that are extremely repellent to water and have a number of interesting applications such as self-cleaning windows and [blood repellent devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111864). I am particularly interested in the potential of these surfaces for use in [chemical sensing techniques such as SERS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133445) to detect very small amounts of target molecules in fields such as bio-sensing and environmental monitoring of pollutants and [toxic chemicals](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.2c02897). 

**Codes**

In addition to my research, I have also written and worked with various codes, including [Matlab](https://boris.unibe.ch/146948/) and Python, and have made some of these codes available on platforms such as Matlabcentral and Github.
