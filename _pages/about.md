Hi! I’m Mahmut Ruzi, Ph.D., a research fellow at the Erciyes University, Kayseri, the [Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (ERNAM)](https://ernam.erciyes.edu.tr). I’m a chemist by training with a focus in vibrational spectroscopy, with mpre than ten years expertise in fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,spectral acquisition, intepretation,and quatum mechanical calculations of rovibrational properties of molecules. Recently shifted focused onto more practical aspects such as fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures for surface enhanced inrared absoprtion (SEIRA) and Raman scattering (SERS). A another interesting resaerch area is superhydrophobic surfaces and its application. 

## My work and research
I use my skills to answere some important questions in chemistry and material science, and can learn new ones as required. One such question is how to develop a covenient and low cost technique to fabricate high performance plasmonic nanostructurs for SEIRA and [SERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy). With such structures, it's possible to quickly detect and identify minute amounts of target molecules in areas such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diganosis,and identification of pathogenic bacteria and virues. Besides getting hands 'dirty' in the lab to fabricate such structures, I also simulate light scattering and absoprtion properties of the structures to shed light on the measured spectra. For such simulations I regularly use finite difference time domain (FDTD), the transfer matrix method (TMM), the rigorously coupled wave analysis (RCWA) approach, and the boundry element method (BEM) with corresponding codes like Meep (FDTD, Python), pyGTM (TMM, Python), RETICOLO (RCWA, Matlab), MNPBEM and NANOBEM (BEM, Matlab). Some complex simulations I use high performance computiong (HPC) infrastructres. 

Another recent research interest is facile fabrication of super water repellent coatings, which is also called [superhydrophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhydrophobic_coating).
