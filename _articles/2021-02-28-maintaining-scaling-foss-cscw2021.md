Abstract: Food waste is a serious problem in our modern era, causing economic loss and exacerbating issues like hunger, environmental pollution, and water shortage. Residual food is one main culprit that can be easily eliminated by proper packaging. Advanced packaging techniques with self-cleaning and anti-fouling capabilities are critically important to tackle this issue. In this regard, superhydrophobic coatings are emerging as an innovative approach to address many critical issues in the food industry. Superhydrophobic coatings can prevent fouling and contamination of food packages. An additional capability is the minimization of food waste and improving consumer experience due to the easy sliding of food from the inner side of the package. In this article, we provide an overview of recent studies on the application of superhydrophobic coatings and surfaces for food packaging applications, with a focus on studies aimed at reducing residual food waste via superhydrophobic coatings prepared from edible, nontoxic, and ecofriendly materials.
