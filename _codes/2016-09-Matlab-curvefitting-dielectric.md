This is a collection of codes that fits dielectric constants to Classical Damped Harmonic Oscillator (CDHO) , Voigt, Fourier series,and Triangular bases functions. For details, see: Spectral curve fitting of dielectric constants, AIP Advances 7, 015042 (2017); 
These codes maybe useful for optical constants (refractive indices, dielectric constant, etc) extraction from absorbance/reflectance spectra measured in limited spectral range. 
The Voigt fitting requires the Voigt/complex error function (File ID: #47801) of Sanjar Abraro, which is downloadable from File exchange. 
The main file is curveift_test.m, which takes a sample data and fits to different curves.
